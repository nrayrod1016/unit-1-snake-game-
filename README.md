Game: Snake! 
https://snake-gamee.surge.sh/


Instructions : 
- Grab as many apples as you can! Avoid your body at all costs!

What I learned? 
CANVAS.JS and Scalable Vectoral Graphics (SVG)!!!!!! I was only able to scratch the surface of what you can do with canvas. My original plan was to use canvas to render a 3D, however that proved too difficult. I look forward to contiuning my research on 3D rendering.

Tech Used: 
HTML CSS JS HTML.Canvas(Canvas.js) 

Future improvments! 
- Adding a score board 
- adjusting velocity aspect and create a button specifically for that 
- add character animation for snake and apple 
- add sound 
Working on implenting a 2D to 3D conversion aspect + 360 rotation. 
Will update.
